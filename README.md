# My Ruby Development Talk

This is kind of a hodgepodge collection of things related to a talk I gave about
Ruby development at RPI. In this repository, we have...

* `gem_playlist.rb`: This was my example one-hour project that dealt with
  piecing together various RubyGems without much prior knowledge of how they
  work individually. It is certainly far from the paragon of well-written Ruby,
  but it was left in its state to show what is possible in only one hour.
* `war_final.rb`: Toward the end of the talk, we built this game from the ground
  up, talking our way through the reasoning behind each step. This version is
  the completed one and contains some comments.
* `notes.txt`: These are my unabridged notes that I tried to follow for the
  talk. I skipped a lot of things to save time, and they're not exactly easy to
  decipher. If for some reason you really want to see them, then look no
  further.

I mentioned that there are some resources that you can use to get better at
Ruby. Here's a list of some of them.

* [Download Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) - This guide has
  instructions for different operating systems. It's pretty easy, unless you
  start installing multiple versions. Then you're in deep if you're not using
  RVM.
* [repl.it](http://repl.it/languages/Ruby) - We used this during the
  presentation. Write code in your browser and play with it in runtime. Quite
  handy.
* [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) - The first 10 problems, at least, are
  great for testing basic operations of a language and getting some feedback at
  the end in the form of other visitors' solutions.
* [Poker hands](http://projecteuler.net/problem=54) - This Project Euler problem
  in particular was one that I did in very clean Ruby and was actually what made
  me realize that I was quite fond of the language. We already did some work
  with cards, so you have a head start.
* [why's poignant guide to ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/) -
  This is where I originally learned Ruby. It is quite popular in the Ruby
  community, particularly for the... quirky narrative scenes it often takes on
  in between discussing code.
* [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/) - A more
  straight-forward guide on learning Ruby.
* [Codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby) - Here's another. For
  free.
* [Ruby Documentation](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/) - I have at least 5 tabs
  of this site open at any given time when working on something related to Ruby.
  Even now it is still an indispensable resource.
